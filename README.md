CC's AS learning recordings

This is the 7th week of my first semester in my sophemore year. which means , the course "Internrt of things and the Mobile application development" has been open for 7 weeks! However , I  just start to really find a way of learning this.
I first knowed about this course during my exchange program in seattle. I found this both challenging and interesting. 
The moment I saw "the virtual Android phone" running on my desktop, I was amazed. 
well, that's all.
wish me luck.
